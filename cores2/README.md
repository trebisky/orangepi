This is a quick proof of concept demo to see if I understand how to start up one of
the other cores in the Quad core Allwinner H3 chip.

It does not work.  I find myself itching to have printf.
I am not going to push this further without printf,
so this is abandoned as not working.

STATUS: This does not work yet.
